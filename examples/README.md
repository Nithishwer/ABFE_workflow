=========

This directory contains example usages of our ABFE_Workflow from different starting points and from different layers (python or CLI).
The data folder contains 2 different starting points: from a simple protein.pdb and small molecule sdf files and from already prepared GROMACS systems with .gro and .top files.
Please also find the expected results in the data directories.
